# LeniaLogic: Emergent Biological Computing 🦠💻

LeniaLogic is a high-performance simulation of a continuous cellular automaton (Lenia) that explores the concept of **Emergent Computation**. It demonstrates that complex, lifelike systems can arise from simple mathematical rules and be utilized for logical operations.

## 🚀 The Concept
Most computers are discrete and rigid. LeniaLogic operates in a continuous domain, utilizing **FFT-accelerated convolutions** to simulate fluid-like biological structures (known as "gliders" or "droplets").

### Key Research Areas:
*   **Continuous Logic:** Moving away from binary 0/1 bits into a gradient-based computational space.
*   **Emergent Structures:** Identifying autonomous "biological" entities that move, interact, and collide predictably.
*   **Kinetic Logic Gates:** Engineering collisions between these entities to perform AND/OR logical operations, proving that biology can be a substrate for Turing-complete computing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Engine:** NumPy + SciPy (Signal Processing)
*   **Visualization:** OpenCV (Real-time high-fidelity rendering)
*   **Mathematical Model:** Integral-differential equations governed by a Gaussian Ring Kernel.

## 🧪 Simulation
The simulation runs a high-frequency loop where every pixel is updated based on its neighbors' density. This creates a "Primordial Soup" where complex life forms evolve and move.
