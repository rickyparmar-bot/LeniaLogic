# 🦠 LeniaLogic: Emergent Biological Computing

LeniaLogic is a high-performance simulation of a continuous cellular automaton (Lenia) that investigates **Emergent Computation**. It explores the hypothesis that lifelike, self-organizing structures can be harnessed as a substrate for unconventional computing.

## 🚀 The Mathematical Core
Unlike discrete systems (like Conway's Game of Life), LeniaLogic operates in a **continuous state space**, utilizing integral-differential equations to govern cell growth.

### 🛠️ Key Achievements
- **FFT-Accelerated Convolutions:** By moving computation into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transforms, the simulation achieves high frame rates even with complex neighborhood kernels.
- **Gaussian Kernel Engineering:** Designed custom neighborhood kernels that foster the evolution of stable, autonomous entities known as "gliders" or "orbium."
- **Kinetic Logic Research:** Investigates the use of colliding gliders as **Kinetic Logic Gates** (AND/OR/NOT). By engineering specific interaction angles, biological structures can perform binary logic operations.
- **Emergent Complexity:** Demonstrates that simple mathematical rules (Convolution + Growth Function) lead to complex, irreducible behaviors traditionally found in biological life.

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Math Engine:** NumPy + SciPy (DSP)
- **Visualization:** OpenCV (Real-time high-fidelity rendering)
